Please make sure to make this folder the root of your project.
This is so the .gitignore can ignore the correct folders and files. 

If done correctly you should see the "Content", "Config" and "Source" folders at the top of the repo.

This repository has been pre-configured with a .gitignore and .gitattributes file specific to Unreal Engine 4 projects using git-lfs. Please fork this repository, then rename and clone it to begin working on your project.
